# Deep Learning models
This folder contains the deep learning models used in this project for multivariate time-series forecasting. They are all built and trained using [Pytorch 2.0.0](https://pytorch.org/) and are thus written in Python.

## Getting started
Assuming that you are using the JetBrains PyCharm IDE, follow these steps to get the python project up and running:
1. After cloning the [repository](https://github.com/KasperHenningsen/P6-Project), open the `ml-models/` folder in PyCharm
2. Go to `File > Settings > Project: ml-models > Python Interpreter` and click `Add Interpreter > Add Local Interpreter`
3. Ensure that you select a **Python 3.9** base interpreter and press `OK`.
   - *The interpreter can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/) under Files* 
4. With the interpreter set up, open the `ml-models/requirements.txt` file, right click any requirement and click `Install All Packages`
5. You should now have a virtual environment set up with all requirements for this project.
